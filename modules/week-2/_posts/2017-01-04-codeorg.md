# Code.org

My hope is that at some point you have heard of code.org.  It made a big splash in the news when it first came out because its whole goal was to show the world that anyone could learn to write code.  Through the Hour of Code, they had celebrities try it out and get people excited about the possiblilities.  In the six years since its release, it has been widely successful and adopted in many schools ranging from elementary to college.

So, we are going to try it out too!  There are courses using Star Wars, Princesses, Minecraft and others.  However, as artists, we are going to focus a more creative version of the code.org. So, we are going to use the Dance Party for our medium.  C'mon it'll be fun!  (Dance Party)[https://studio.code.org/s/dance/stage/1/puzzle/1]

Once you are done, don't forget to save you certificate.  Just take a screen shot and save that image. You will turn that in for your homework. On windows, just press the `PrtScn` button.  On the Mac,  `Command+Shift+3`

Finally, we are going to do some more exploration using Artist Lab.  Go to (Artist Lab)[https://studio.code.org/s/artist/stage/1/puzzle/1], go through the tutorial and then create something at the end. Please take a screen shot of that creation and then upload with your certificate from the previous exercise.
