# Mindset

In this section, we talk about how our mindset sets us up for success.  Too often we get stuck in the mindset that we are only good at one thing or that we are "talented" in only certain subjects.  Have you ever thought: "I am not a Math person" or "I just can't do that" whatever "that" is?  Well, that is not uncommon.  This is called the "Fixed Mindset".  I think it is important that we take a look at this from a different perspective.  So, I would like you to read a few short paragraphs on Mindset.
