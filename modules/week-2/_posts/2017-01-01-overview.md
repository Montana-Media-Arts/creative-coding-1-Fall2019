# Week 2 Overview <br />Code.org and the beginning of our new mindset

In the first week, we spent time discussing what creative coding is, looked at the graphical user interface, the command line, and introduced GitHub.com. This week we are going to look at our mindset and determine what is possible and start to change our mindset.  Chances are you have done this many times in your life and maybe you didn't realize it.  We are going to take inspiration from the Last Lecture and from Mindset by Carol Drucker. Then, we will start with Code.org and see what is possible.  Ready?  I am.
