## Overview of the Course

This course is designed to teach code so that it can become a tool for art, creativity and fun.

The goal is to begin a journey in which the creative and technical possibilities of the computer become a tool in your palate. These tools will become an extension of you, something you think through, express yourself through, and can contribute to the world through. Ultimately, this course is designed to offer you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation.

The course focuses on the fundamentals of programming the computer (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) while also touching on a few advanced topics, and relating this all back to the creative and expressive possibilities of media art and the beginning of game programming. We start by using a number of "visually-based" programming languages and then we will transition into a JavaScript-based, ‘p5.js’, programming framework. The course will conclude, with your design, development, and implementation of a final project of your choosing.

This is exclusively an on-line course. As such, you will be expected to engage with all content through this site along with Moodle to turn in assignments and engage with discussions. You will be assessed through regular project-based assignments, writings, and community engagement.

## What to Expect

This course will expose you to new technologies, while also thinking about design, and content creation. Some weeks will lean more technical in nature, while others will lean more creative-based.

Just as the content focus will shift, so to will the work amount. Some weeks, especially those when new topics are being introduced, it might feel a little heavier. However, I want you to have a chance to practice with these new technologies and techniques so you feel comfortable with them. Some weeks will hopefully feel as if you are exploring and playing a little more.

## Class Goals

There are 4 high-level goals for this course;

1. Learn how to problem solve. (More specifically, how to break a problem down into sub-problems that are easier to solve by themselves)
2. Adapt to constantly changing technological paradigms by learning how to learn. (Skills acquisition.)
3. Combine technical and artistic practices through inquiry and iteration.
4. Adopt and use professional practices.
