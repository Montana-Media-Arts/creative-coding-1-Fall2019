# Week 3 Overview <br />


This week we are going to dig a little deeper, figuratively and literally into our thoughts on developing software and how it can apply in more areas in life than just this class.  We are going to start with a section based on Grit.  Another book I read recently, Grit The Power of Passion and Perseverance, by Angela Duckworth, is an excellent book for you all to look through when you have free time. It works hand-in-hand with Mindset and looks at our "Grit" which is how much are we will to really dig in and accomplish something.  This isn't always easy so we will look at this.  

Additionally, we will start looking at a new programming language paradigm called Scratch.  It was invented at MIT (that little 'ole place) and it allows you to create some really fun programs in a highly visible and interactive way.  You can see your progress quickly and it makes the whole experience a lot of fun.  We will start on the basics and then we will extend it.
