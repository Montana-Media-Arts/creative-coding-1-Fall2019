# Scratch Costumes


Costumes in Scratch serve a couple of purposes.  You can think of them like regular costumes. You can have the cat wear a tie and a suit.  You can have the cat have shorts and a t-shirt.  You can also have different costumes for the cat to help mimic more realistic movement. In this section, I will show you how to use costumes to mimic movement using some of the built-in costumes.  However, feel free to create costumes too!

Make sure you add multiple costumes and be able to switch between them.
