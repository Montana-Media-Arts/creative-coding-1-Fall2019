# Homework

## Putting it all together

Yes, the time has come for you to create a small game in Scratch.  I know you can do it. I might take a little Grit, I believe in you.  You have the freedom to make your game however you would like, but here is what I would like to see:

1. At least two characters.
2. Each character should have at least three costumes.
3. At least two backgrounds.
4. There should be broadcasting.
5. There should be a variable or more.
6. There should be a background sound or otherwise.
7. You should upload your .sb3 file to your repository and send in your link.
