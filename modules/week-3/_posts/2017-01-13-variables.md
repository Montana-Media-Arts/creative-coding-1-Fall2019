# Variables

Alert!  Technical term.  Variables which I am sure you have seen before can seem a little daunting, vague, or both.  Variables are nothing more than names that can hold values.  We are going to create a score variable so that we can keep track of our score when we collide with something.

Watch this video to see how to create a variable.

Can you create a variable?  What did you name it?  Was it a good name? Can all sprites see it?  Does it show up on your screen?
