# Communication

So, what happens if you have two sprites?  Give that a try.  Add a second sprite. Notice how each sprite has it's own code.  How do they talk to each other.  In order to do that, we are going to use `Broadcast`.  This allows one sprite to send a message to another.  Watch this video on broadcasting and then give it a try.

Can you make your sprites talk?  Good!
