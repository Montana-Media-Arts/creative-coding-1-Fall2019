# Communication

So, what happens if you have two sprites?  Give that a try.  Add a second sprite. Notice how each sprite has its own set of code.  How do they talk to one another? To do that, we are going to use `Broadcast`.  Broadcast allows one sprite to send a message to another.  Watch this video on broadcasting and then give it a try.

Can you make your sprites talk?  Good!
