# Wrap Up & Conclusions

Really nice job this week.  We took a whirlwind around Scratch and I hope you enjoyed it. It's fun little language and there is a lot you can do once you become more familiar.  We learned ourselves and our Grit and we programmed with more freedom this week.  Feels good yes?

## Next Week

Next week, we will go to App Lab and Game Lab.  They have roots in Code.org, but they give you even more freedom.  It might look a little funny at first, but never fear, I will help you along the way.
