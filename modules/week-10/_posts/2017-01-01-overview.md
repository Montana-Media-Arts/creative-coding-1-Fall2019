# Week 10 Overview <br />


<br />

This week is all about movement.  Let's make things move in p5.js.  In order to that though we must know how to implement a few things in p5.  At first glance, this might seem a little daunting, but the best part is that you have already done this and I know you are going to excel at this too.

With motion, that allows us to be even more creative than we were last week.  We will stick with simple shapes for now to get the extra practice.  Remember everything we do each week should build on the work that was done from the prior weeks.

Finally, our discussion question for the week is all about creating art and gaming.  Is there a relationship between the two? What is the same to you?  What is different?  Is the creative process the same or different? Let's hear your thoughts!
