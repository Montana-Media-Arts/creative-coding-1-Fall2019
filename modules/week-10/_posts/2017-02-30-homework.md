# Homework

This week, you are going to animate your self-portrait.  Now that you know how to make objects move back and forth, choose some to go back and forth along the x-axis, and some along the y-axis and some even using both the x and y-axis.  Finally make the title of your portrait get bigger 5 times and then smaller 5 times.  Repeat that forever.

Specifics:

1. Make at least 2 simple shapes in your self-portrait move back and forth along the x-axis.
2. Make at least 2 simple shapes in your self-portait move back and forth along the y-axis.
3. Have the shapes move at different random speeds.
4. Make at least 1 shape move back and forth along the x and y axis (diagonally).
5. Make the title of your self-portrait get larger five times and then get smaller 5 times. Repeat forever.
6. Create a short video talking about your project.
7. Upload your project and video to GitHub and turn your link into Moodle.
