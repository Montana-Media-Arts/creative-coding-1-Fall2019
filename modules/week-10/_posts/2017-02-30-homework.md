# Homework

This week, you are going to animate your self-portrait.  Now that you know how to make objects move back and forth, choose a few simple shapes to go back and forth along the x-axis.  Also, select a couple of your shapes to move along the y-axis, and at least one simple shape to move using both the x and y-axis.  Finally, make the title of your portrait get bigger five times and then smaller five times.  Repeat that forever.

Specifics:

1. Make at least two simple shapes in your self-portrait move back and forth along the x-axis.
2. Make at least two simple shapes in your self-portrait move back and forth along the y-axis.
3. Have the shapes move at different random speeds.
4. Make at least one shape move back and forth along the x and y-axis (diagonally).
5. Make the title of your self-portrait get larger five times and then get smaller five times. Repeat forever.
6. Create a short video talking about your project.
7. Upload your project and video to GitHub and turn your link into Moodle.

**Want something extra to do?**

1. Change the colors of your shapes every time they hit the wall.
2. Change your name text so that it moves in a square pattern.
3. Make your head get bigger and then smaller continuously.
