# Week 4 Overview


This week we are going to start off by discussing who has helped us along the way.  Often in our society, we are really proud of our independence and you should be. However, I am guessing that somewhere along the way, someone was there for you to help pick you up, guide you or provide encouragement right when you needed it.  Who was that person?  What did they do for you?  This is our discussion for the week, so jot down some notes and share this in the discussion section of the class.

We will also go back to Code.org but instead of looking their more directed paths, we are going to look at App Lab and Game Lab so we can create an App right in the browser and we can create a Game in the browser too.  They are both pretty open ended and even though they still use drag and drop techniques, it is a little more reading that before.  Again, we slowly but surely moving in the direction.  So, keep note.  Ready?  Let's go!
