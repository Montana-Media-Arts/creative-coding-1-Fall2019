# Create your game in Code.org

Here's where you get to be creative again.  In this exercise, you can create your own game.  It will walk you through the commands and then give you the option to develop your game at the end.  That is what you will share in your repository.

Before you start creating, though, think about the type of game you want to create.  Design it before you write code (or drag and drop the code).  Planning makes your life better in the long run because you can work out your ideas before you start writing any code.  Employing good design is a good rule of thumb for anyone.
