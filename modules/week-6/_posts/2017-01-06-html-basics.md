# HTML Basics


What other tags do we need to make stuff show up?

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <h1>My first website</h1>
        <p></p>
        My stuff is really important.
        <br>
        How do you like them apples?
    </body>
</html>

```

What are these tags?

1. body tag - this tag surrounds all the tags that are to show up in the web browser window.
2. h1 - this is a header tag. There are headers 1-6 where h1 is the largest and h6 is the smallest
3. p - the p tag creates paragraph breaks
4. br - the br tag creates a simple line break

Now, you try this below.  You can copy and paste the code into the section below, and see what it does.
