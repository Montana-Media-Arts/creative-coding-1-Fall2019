# Week 6 Overview <br />

This week we are going to look at websites.  Websites are all around us, but so are other mediums. Is there still a need for websites? With social media sites like Instagram and Facebook, do we need to create something from scratch?  What about templates such as WordPress and Drupal?  With those frameworks, do we need to learn HTML?  

That's our discussion topic for the week, so go over to Moodle and share your thoughts.

One of the things I like are examples of good and bad websites.  Let's look at some good ones.
