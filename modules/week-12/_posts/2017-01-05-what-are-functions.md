# What are Functions

Functions are pieces of code that perform actions.  What does that mean?  Well, let's think about the two main functions we already use.

```js
    function setup()
    {

    }

    function draw()
    {

    }
```
Both setup and draw are functions that perform actions.  The **setup** function is called only one time, and it calls  **createCanvas**, which is also a function!  The **draw** is also a function that is called continuously and allows us to make things appear in our browser.

How do we know they are functions?

```js
    function setup()
    {

    }
```

Let's look at the **setup** function.  It's easy to know what section is a function because it starts with the keyword **function**.  Then it is followed by the name of the function, in this case, **setup**, and then the function name is always followed by **()** parentheses.  Finally, the body of the function is surrounded by **{}** curly braces.

Does this look familiar?  It should!  It appears like if statement.
