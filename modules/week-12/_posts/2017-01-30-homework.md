# Homework

For this homework, you are going to alter your spore-like game.  You are going to create some functions and call them. Again, don't worry about collisions.

## Specifications

1. Create a function that creates a player.
2. Create a function to move the player using the keyboard.
3. Create a function that draws the circle to the screen when pressing the mouse.
4. Create a function that creates multiple obstacles of different sizes and colors on the screen (okay if you still have only 2).
5. Create different functions to move each of the obstacles around randomly around the screen.  If they leave the screen, have them come back on the other side.
6. Create a function to generate the exit
7. Create a function to display the "You win" message.
8. If the player gets to the exit, call the "you win" function.
9. Your draw() function should contain only function calls along with the background function.
10. Ignore all collisions.
