# Functions

If you recall when we changed the text in the span tag, we had to put the JavaScript script at the bottom so that it wouldn't give us an error.

What if we wanted to make it so that the JavaScript code didn't run automatically. Insert **functions**. You have seen them already. You used them with **alert**, **log**, **write**, **getElementById**. Now we are going to create one ourselves. 

Functions look like this.

```html
 function myFunction()
 {
    window.alert("Hi there!");
 }
```

We just created a function called **myFunction**, and it contains one line of code, which just so happens to be another window.alert. However, it will not run unless we call myFunction somewhere.

One thing you might notice is that there are **{}** before and after the window.alert. These indicate where the function body begins and ends. Without them, the function doesn't work.

What does this look like on a full page?

```html
<html>
    <title>Functions</title>
    <head>
        <script>
            function displayFavoriteColor()
            {
                var favoriteColor = "blue";
                document.getElementById("myTag").innerHTML = "Favorite Color " + favoriteColor;
            }       
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <span id="myTag">This is my favorite text</span>
    </body>
 </html>
```

Since the function is not called, you should see just the original text. How do we call this function? Below is one way.

```html
<html>
    <title>Functions</title>
    <head>
        <script>
            function displayFavoriteColor()
            {
                var favoriteColor = "blue";
                document.getElementById("myTag").innerHTML = "Favorite Color " + favoriteColor;
            }       
        </script>
    </head>
    <body onload="displayFavoriteColor();">
        <span id="myTag">This is my favorite text</span>
    </body>
 </html>
```

Placing the function name in the **onload** event of the body is one way to call the function. This event is just a unique attribute of the body and allows us to call JavaScript functions. Neat huh?

Now the text should be changed right when you open the page.

What about parameters?

This is what it would look like.
```html

<html>
    <title>Functions</title>
    <head>
    <script>
        function displayFavoriteColor(color)
        {
            var favoriteColor = color;
            document.getElementById("myTag").innerHTML = "My favorite color is " + favoriteColor;
        }
    </script>
    </head>
    <body onload="displayFavoriteColor('blue');">
        <span id="myTag">This is my favorite text</span>
    </body>
</html>
 ```
We declare the variable in the displayFavoriteColor function.  It is called **color**.  Then, we assign that variable to the favoriteColor variable in the function.  Then, in the onload event, we pass in a value.  In this case, we pass in a value of **blue** inside of single quotes.  We do this because the onload puts the function call inside of double quotes.

What about getting information from a form or something like that? Move on, and you will find out!
