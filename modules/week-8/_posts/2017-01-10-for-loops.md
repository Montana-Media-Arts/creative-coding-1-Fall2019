# for Loops

In our last section, we were able to make a single question appear. However, what if we wanted questions to appear a set number of times everytime we answer a question?

Introducting the **for** loop.  These are handy loops that allow to perform actions over and over without having the write the code or call the function over and over.   What do they look like?

```html
    for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {

    }
```

As you can see there a few parts here.

1. for - this is the part that tells the computer that it's a for loop.
2. ( - this indicates that it is the beginning of the for loop and we are going to put all the pieces required for the loop to run inside of these parentheses.
3. var i = 0; - this is the initialization part of the for loop.  This create a variable **i** and gives it a value of 0.  You have to end this part with a **;** so that the for loops knows that the initialization part is done.
4. i < 5 - this section is the evaluation part of the for loop.  This checks to see if i is less than 5.  If it is, then do everything that is in the **{}** (curly braces).  
5. i++ - after the body of the for loop (everything in the curly braces) has run, then the variable **i** is increment by 1 and then the loop continues by evaluating if this new value of i is still less than 5.  

The end result is that this loop runs 5 times, from 0 to 4.  We can prove to ourselves by creating and running this page.

```html
<html>
        <title>If statements</title>
        <head>
            <script>
                function theForLoop()
                {
                    var result = "";
                    for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
                    {

                        result += i + "<br>";
                    }
                    document.getElementById("theResult").innerHTML = result;
                }
                
            </script>
        </head>
        <body onload="theForLoop();">
            <div id="theResult"></div>   
        </body>
    </html>
```
If you run this page, you see that all numbers print out from 0 to 4 right? So, how do we apply this to our game?

```html
<html>
        <title>If statements</title>
        <head>
            <script>
                var actualAnswer;
                function printQuestion()
                {
                   var number1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
                   var number2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
                    actualAnswer = number1 + number2;
                    document.getElementById("theQuestion").innerHTML = "What is " + number1 + "+" + number2 + "?";
                    
                }
                function checkAnswer()
                {
                   var answer = document.getElementById("txtAnswer").value;
                   if(answer == actualAnswer)
                   {
                    document.getElementById("finalResult").innerHTML = "Good job!";
                   }
                   else
                   {
                       document.getElementById("finalResult").innerHTML = "Not quite!";
                   }
                   
                }

                function runGame()
                {
                    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
                    {
                        printQuestion();
                    }

                }
            </script>
        </head>
        <body onload="runGame();">
            <div id="theQuestion"></div>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Your answer</td>
                    <td><input type="text" id="txtAnswer"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2"><button id="btnSubmit" onClick="checkAnswer();"></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <div id="finalResult"></div>
        </body>
    </html>
```

If you closely, you see that I create a third function called **runGame** and then called that function in the onload event of the body.  Inside the body of the runGame function, I called the **printQuestion** function.  Be mindful that I called it by calling the function and the put the **()** afterward to indicate that that it is a function and then I completed the line with a semi-colon **;**.

Run this page.  Does it work? Great!
