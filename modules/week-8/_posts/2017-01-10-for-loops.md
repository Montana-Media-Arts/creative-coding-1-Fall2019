# for Loops

In our last section, we were able to make a single question appear. However, what if we want questions to appear a set number of times every time we answer a question?

Introducing the **for** loop. These are handy tools allowing us to perform actions repeatedly without having the write the code or call a function multiple times. What is the syntax of a for loop?

```html
    <script>
        for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {

        }
    </script>
```

As you can see, there a few parts here.

1. for - this is the part that tells the computer that it's a for loop.
2. ( - this is the beginning of the for loop. The pieces required for the loop to evaluate correctly are inside of the parentheses.
3. var i = 0; - this is the initialization part of the for loop. **var** creates a variable **i** and gives it a value of 0. The statement ends with a **;** completing the initialization part.
4. i < 5 - this section is the evaluation part of the for loop. The evaluation statement checks to see if i is less than 5. If it is, then do everything that is in the **{}** (curly braces). 
5. i++ - after the body of the for loop (everything in the curly braces) has run, then the variable **i** is incremented by one, and then the loop continues by evaluating if this new value of i is still less than 5. 

The result is that this loop runs five times, from 0 to 4. We can prove to ourselves by creating and running this page.

```html
<html>
    <title>for loops</title>
    <head>
        <script>
            function theForLoop()
            {
                var result = "";
                for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
                {
                    result += i + "<br>";
                }
                document.getElementById("theResult").innerHTML = result;
            }  
        </script>
    </head>
    <body onload="theForLoop();">
        <div id="theResult"></div> 
    </body>
 </html>
```

If you run this page, you see that all numbers print out from 0 to 4 right? So, how do we apply this to our game?

```html
<html>
    <title>for Loops</title>
    <head>
    <script>
        var actualAnswer;
        var number1;
        var number2;
        function printQuestion()
        {
            actualAnswer = number1 + number2;
            document.getElementById("theQuestion").innerHTML = "What is " + number1 + "+" + number2 + "?";
        }
        function checkAnswer()
        {
            var answer = document.getElementById("txtAnswer").value;
            if(answer == actualAnswer)
            {
                document.getElementById("finalResult").innerHTML = "Good job!";
                runGame();
            }
            else
            {
                document.getElementById("finalResult").innerHTML = "Try Again!";
            }
        }

        function runGame()
        {
            for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            {
                 number1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
                 number2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
            }
            printQuestion();
        }
    </script>
    </head>
    <body onload="runGame();">
        <div id="theQuestion"></div>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Your answer</td>
                    <td><input type="text" id="txtAnswer"></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2"><button id="btnSubmit" onClick="checkAnswer();">Submit</button></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        <div id="finalResult"></div>
    </body>
 </html>
```

If you look carefully, you see that I create a third function called **runGame** and then call that function in the onload event of the body. Inside the body of the runGame function, I call the **printQuestion** function. Notice that the function call always ends with the **()** afterward to indicate that it is a function, and then I completed the line with a semi-colon **;**.

Run this page. Does it work? Great!
