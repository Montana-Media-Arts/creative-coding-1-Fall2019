# Homework

This week's homework incorporates JavaScript into your HTML pages. You are going to add some basic form validation on the Contact Us page. Then, you will add a fourth page, which has a simple math game. However, you will need to change it so that it also keeps track of how many the player gets correct and wrong. You should also show them their final percentage. For example, if they get 2/4 correct, they should see that they got 50% of the questions right.

Specifics:

1. On the Contact Us page, make the name, email, and terms of the agreement required.
2. If they do not enter something, then put the focus (you are going to have to do some research to complete this one) on that textbox and turn the textbox red.
3. For the simple math game, change the game so that it keeps track of how many answers were correct and how many were incorrect after 10 questions.
4. Print out the number of correct and incorrect answers.
5. Print out the percentage of correct answers to the total number of questions.
6. Upload a link to your video about your game and your validation.  Point out anything interesting in your code.
7. Upload the everything into GitHub and turn in your link to Moodle.
