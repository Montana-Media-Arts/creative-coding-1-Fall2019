# Homework

This week's homework incorporates JavaScript into your HTML pages.  You are going to add some basic form validation on your contact us page.  Then, you will add a fourth page which has the simple math game.  However, you will need to change it so that it also keeps track of how many the player gets correct and wrong. You should also show them their final percentage.  For example if they get 2/4 correct, they should see that they got 50% of the questions correct.

Specifics:

1. On the contact us page, make the name, email and terms of agreement, required.
2. If they do not enter something, then put the focus (you are going to have search for this one) on that textbox and turn the textbox red.
3. For the simple math game, change it the game so that it keeps track of how many answers were correct and how many were incorrect.
4. Print out the number of correct and incorrect totals.
5. Print out the percentage of correct answers to the total number of questions.
