# Weekly Conclusions

Did you realize you have already learned 5 different programming paradigms?  Can you believe it? It's kind of fun right?  Well, I think we are ready to write out our code. Starting with HTML, we will then look at CSS and then JavaScript.  This will get us ready for p5.js which is just a version of JavaScript.  I hope you are as excited as I am!
