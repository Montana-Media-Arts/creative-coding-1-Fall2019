# Week 7 Overview

This week is all about style and making websites look "good."  What does that mean?  We are going to look at CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and how they play a role. We will look at an accessible library and how it helps us style websites.  

For our discussion, we are going to talk about "The eye of the beholder."  I assume most of you have heard this saying, but it becomes even more apparent with website styling.  So, how do we deal with a situation when we create something beautiful, but our client doesn't like it.  Or how do we best communicate with a client that their idea is NOT lovely?  These are not easy and require specific communication skills.  How would you approach this?
