# Week 7 Overview

This week is all about style and making websites look "good".  What does that mean?  We are going to look at CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and how they play a role. We will look at a popular library and how it helps us style websites.  

For our discussion, we are going to talk about "The eye of the beholder."  I assume most of you have heard this saying, but it becomes even more apparent with website styling.  So, how do we create something that is beautiful but our client doesn't like it.  Or how do we best communicate with a client that their idea is NOT beautiful?  These are not easy and requires certain communication skills.  How would you approach this?
