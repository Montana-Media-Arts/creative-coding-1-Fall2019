# Adding CSS to HTML

There are three ways in which we can add CSS to an HTML page.

1. Inline
2. Embedded
3. External

With **Inline** styles, they are applied directly to the tag.  An example might something like this.

```html
<a href="http://www.ebay.com" style="text-decoration:none">Ebay</a>
```

This style removes the underline from the link to Ebay.  It is important to note that style only applies to this particular tag and no other ones in this page.  We will return to this point later.
