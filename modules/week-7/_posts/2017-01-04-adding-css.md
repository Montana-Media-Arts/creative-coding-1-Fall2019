# Adding CSS to HTML

## Inline Styles

There are three ways in which we can add CSS to an HTML page.

1. Inline
2. Embedded
3. External

With **Inline** styles, they are applied directly to the tag as they are added as another attribute to the tag.  An example might something like this.

```html
<a href="http://www.ebay.com" style="text-decoration:none">Ebay</a>
```

This style removes the underline from the link to Ebay.  It is important to note that style only applies to this particular tag and no other ones in this page.  We will return to this point later.

What do we need to consider when we use inline styles?
