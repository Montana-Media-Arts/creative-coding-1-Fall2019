# Week 9 Overview <br />


<br />


This week, we are starting on p5.js.

What is p5.js, you say?  It is a JavaScript library allowing us to become even more creative and also write simple games if we want.  We want to make sure that we start on the right foot, so we are going to get it installed and make sure we have everything set before we begin.
