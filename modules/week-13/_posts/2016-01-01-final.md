# Final Project

For your final project, you will create a "Portfolio" of your work. You should take screenshots where appropriate and add a page in your web project that shows all the projects you created. You should write a description under each project image. Don't forget to link to this new portfolio page from your original pages.   

Next week and the following week, there will be no formal class, including the live session. However, if you need me, please do not hesitate to contact me!
