# Week 13 Overview <br />



This week, we will discuss Arrays.  As always, we will discuss what they are, why we use them and then apply them to our project.

We will also look at what is required for your final and I will give you a final outline of the rest of the semester will proceed.

Our final discussion question is based on how do you feel you have changed throughout the semester.  How has your perception toward programming changed?  For the better?  For worse? (I hope not!) Stayed the same?  Did it spurn curiosity?  As always I look forward to reading your responses.
