# Why Learn about Arrays?

As you know we have been creating items on the screen and they have been moving and that has been fantastic. However, we really only creating two items along with the player right?  

What happens when I have to add another? Let's look at some code.

```js
    var x = 50;
    var y = 50;
    var diameter = 25;
```

Do you remember this?  We needed these three variables to create one circle right?  We created a function with random numbers so that we could create multiple circles.  That was pretty cool right?  However, they were all created in the draw.  Which is fine, but remember, it made them bounce all around.  What if we wanted to create multiple circles that did not move?

At the moment, we would have to do something like this.

```js
    var x = 50;
    var y = 50;
    var diameter = 25;
    var x1 = 150;
    var y1 = 150;
    var diameter1 = 125;

    function setup()
    {
        createCanvas(800,600);
    }

    function draw()
    {
        circle(x,y,diameter);
        circle(x1,y1,diameter1)
    }
```

What if you wanted a third? A fourth? What if I wanted 500?  Yikes! Do you see what is happening here?

This is why we have arrays.  With arrays, we can add as many circles as we want and then do something with them.
