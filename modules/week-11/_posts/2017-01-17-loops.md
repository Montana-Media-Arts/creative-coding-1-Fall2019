# Loops

So, there are two main types of loops.  I will introduce you to them, however, we have been using a major loop this whole time. It's called **draw**.  To create a **for** loop, it looks like this.

```js
    function setup()
    {
        createCanvas(600,800);
    }
    function draw()
    {
        for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            console.log(i);
        }
    }
    
```

Try it out.  It should print out all the numbers fro 0 to 4.  Did you get that?  Great!

The other type of loop is a **while** loop.

It looks something like this.

```js
    function setup()
    {
        createCanvas(600,800);
    }
    function draw()
    {
        var i = 0;
        while(i < 5)
        {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        }
    }
```

Let's use these to print the numbers to the screen.

```js
    var x = 0;
    function setup()
    {
        createCanvas(600,800);
        frameRate(10);
    }
    function draw()
    {
       
        background(255);
        for(var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
          
            textSize(28);
            text(i,x,100);
            x+=100;
          
        }
        x = 0;
    }
    
```
Do you see all the numbers?  That's because we are printing them out the screen using our for loop.  Cool huh? Can we do this with a while loop too?

```js
    var x = 0;
    function setup()
    {
        createCanvas(600,800);
    }
    function draw()
    {
        var i = 0;
        while(i < 5)
        {
            textSize(28);
            text(i,x,100);
            x+=100;
            i++;
        }
        x = 0;
    }
```

These are really useful, however, we won't revisit this in detail until we get to arrays.  So, keep this in your back pocket.
